jQuery wp-json connects to the JSON API wordpress plugin.

See http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/other_notes/

It performs a simple lookup, and currently nothing more.
Results are output into the subject element, which can contain a
child element with the class 'loading' that will be manipulated
with the return of the AJAX call.
